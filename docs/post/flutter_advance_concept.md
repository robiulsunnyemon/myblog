# Advanced Flutter Concepts for Experienced Developers

As an experienced Flutter developer looking to level up, here are some advanced concepts you should explore:

## State Management Deep Dive
- **Riverpod 2.0** with its new features (async notifiers, providers)
- **BLoC/Cubit** with advanced patterns (multi-bloc communication, bloc observers)
- **StateNotifier** with freezed for immutable state
- **Redux** patterns in Flutter (for complex app state)

## Performance Optimization
- **RenderObject** and custom painting
- **Isolates** for heavy computation
- **ListView.builder** vs **CustomScrollView** optimizations
- **DevTools** deep profiling
- **Shaders** and jank prevention

## Advanced UI Techniques
- **CustomPaint** and **Canvas** drawing
- **Slivers** for complex scrolling effects
- **Hero** animations with custom transitions
- **Implicit vs Explicit** animations mastery
- **ShaderMask** and **ClipPath** effects

## Architecture Patterns

- **Repository pattern** with offline-first
- **Dependency Injection** (get_it, injectable)
- **Feature-first** project structure

## Platform Integration
- **Platform Channels** for native code
- **FFI (Foreign Function Interface)**
- **Custom Flutter Engine** modifications
- **Pigeon** for type-safe platform channels

## Testing
- **Golden tests** for UI regression
- **Widget tests** with complex interactions
- **Integration tests** with Flutter Driver
- **Mocking** strategies (mocktail, mockito)

## Compilation & Build
- **Dart AOT** compilation details
- **Tree shaking** and code size optimization
- **Flutter Web** performance tuning
- **Custom flavors** and build configurations

## Emerging Technologies
- **Flutter 3D** with flutter_3d_obj
- **Machine Learning** with tflite
